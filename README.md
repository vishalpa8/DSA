## DSA
 * this project contains code with different approaches. so you can quickly revise the logic.

### Algorithm:-    
   * i will kept all the algorithms which is necessary and it will give you boost in your problem solving.

### Data Structure:-
   * it contains data structure implementation for quick revision which can help to solve the problem in a very efficient way.

### Must Revise Algorithm:-
   * those algorithms, actually it is little bit difficult to understand so keep revising it. after you got the logic of that algorithm.

### Sorting:-
   * this folder contains important sorting algorithms.

### String Algorithms:-
   * i only separate that string algorithm, in future i'll accordingly separate them so it would be make it easier for us.
