# DSA

File or Code for Every kind of Algorithm and Data Structure
with problems with different approaches.

#Algorithm:-    
    - i will kept all the algorithms which is necessary and it will give you boost in your problem solving.

# Data Structure:-
    - it contains data structure implementation for quick revision which can help to solve the problem in a very efficient way.

# Must Revise Algorithm:-
    - those algorithms, actually it is little bit difficult to understand so keep revising it. after you got the logic of that algorithm.

# Sorting:-
    - this folder contains important sorting algorithms.

# String Algorithms:-
    - i only separate that string algorithm, in future i'll accordingly separate them so it would be make it easier for us.
